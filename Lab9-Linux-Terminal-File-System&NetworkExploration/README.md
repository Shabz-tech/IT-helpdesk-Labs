# Linux Terminal, File System & Network Exploration

## Overview
This mini lab demonstrates my foundational skills using the Linux terminal, file system, and basic networking tools. I explored a Linux Virtual Machine (Ubuntu and Mint) and spent several hours practicing file navigation, manipulation, and network scanning. This was done as part of developing essential troubleshooting and system administration capabilities relevant to IT Help Desk and sysadmin roles.

## What I Explored

### File System & Terminal
- Navigated the Linux file system using:
  - cd, ls, pwd, tree, find
- Explored key Linux directories:
  - /home, /etc, /var, /usr, /bin, /opt, /tmp, /root, /dev
- Edited and viewed files:
  - Used nano, cat, touch, less, head, tail
- Managed files and folders:
  - mkdir, mv, cp, rm, chmod, chown
- Practiced disk space and directory size checks:
  - df -h, du -sh

### Networking & Port Scanning
- Performed basic network diagnostics:
- Scanned open ports and services with:
  - nmap localhost
  - sudo nmap -sU localhost
  - sudo nmap -sV localhost
  - sudo nmap -A localhost
- Identified local device ports, potential vulnerabilities, and running services
- Understood the importance of open/closed ports and their impact on system security
